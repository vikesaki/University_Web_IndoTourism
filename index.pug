It consists of more than 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, as well as parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the largest archaeological state in the world and the 14th largest country by area - 1,904,569 square kilometers (735,358 square miles). Considering that there are tens of thousands of islands to explore, it can be difficult to choose the best place to travel in Indonesia. The archipelago, as diverse as it is dramatic, has many attractive attractions: the cultural core of Ubud, a colossal Buddhist stupa towering over Java, turquoise crater lakes and rocky peaks of Gunung Rinjani, dazzling white sand beaches on the Gili Islands.')

The popular agglomeration of Kuta-Legian-Seminyak has an 8-kilometer strip of golden sand, along which there are residential buildings, shops and bars, while the neighboring Changu is less developed and has wilder beaches. Bukit Peninsula is a popular surfing spot, and snorkeling and diving can be enjoyed on the quiet island of Nusa Lembongan and the beach resorts of Amed and Padang Bai. Ubud is the undisputed cultural capital of Bali thanks to its traditional dance and music performances, as well as a number of yoga studios and art galleries.')

In the south is the homeland of ethnic Javanese and the center of their traditional art, culture and language, personified by the royal courts of Yogyakarta and Solo. To the east, the Gunung Bromo volcanic massif offers excellent hiking opportunities, especially at dawn. Other places include the ancient temples of the Dieng Plateau, the turquoise Kawah Ijen Lake and the palm-fringed beaches around Pangandaran.')

Visually, its stunning, with the imposing bulk of Gunung Rinjani towering over turquoise crater lakes. Not far from the shore are the legendary Gili Islands, surrounded by white sand beaches and pristine coral reefs.

    +block-content-2('img/sumatra.jpg', 'Sumatra', 'A paradise for explorers, most of Sumatra remains undiscovered. Most of the attractions on the beaten path are concentrated north of the old Trans-Sumatran Highway: Bukit Lawang jungle filled with orangutans; Danau Toba, the spiritual center of the charming Batak tribe; Berastagi twin volcanoes; and Pulau Weh diving sites. To the west, you will discover Bukittinggi – the cultural capital of the Minangkabau Highlands – and the jungle-surrounded Lake Danau Maninjau.')
